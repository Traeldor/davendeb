Hello there. I'm Dave, and I'm an aspiring web designer.
I am a 59 year old Diabetic, with heart health issues.<br />
During this Covid-19 pandemic, I have spent months not working.<br />
I have begun to study web development, and I'm learning about how to make
webpages<br />
My wife and I have also begun an online affiliate program, to learn how
to make money online. <em>Hopefully</em> this will make us some money and
I won't have to work anymore!<br />
It wasn't always this way, decades ago I wanted to be an electronics
  technician. I built my first AM radio when I was 14YO. Joined the
USAF to continue learning and working on electronics. They put me
into installations, so my career changed to being an electrician.
Got married, had a kid, got "old". heh heh. Oh yeah, I've had a couple
of heart attacks along the way. Now my health prohibits me
 from doing anything heavy or stressful. So I'm going to focus a career
 change on web design. May God bless me on this endeavor.
